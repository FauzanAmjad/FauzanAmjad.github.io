  <h2>Modeling Animal Behavior w/ AI</h2>
  <h3>Vicario Lab Overview</h3>
  <p>"Songbirds use their songs and calls to communicate in social and reproductive contexts. They learn to make these
    sounds through a process of vocal imitation that has much in common with human speech acquisition. Very few animals
    are capable of this form of behavioral learning. It involves auditory discrimination, auditory memory and
    sensorimotor learning. We can study the brain mechanisms of each of these processes, because the relevant brain
    pathways have been identified in songbirds. Experiments in the laboratory involve a range of techniques from
    behavioral observations and sound processing to neurophysiology and neuroanatomy." - <a

      Abstract: Discriminating between ethologically-relevant auditory stimuli is a fundamental ability that allows
      animals to appropriately navigate within their environment. Previous research with human infants suggests that
      this ability may be present early in development, since the introduction of novel sounds elicits unconditioned
      head-turning. Zebra finches (Zfs), a species of songbird, are often used to study auditory perception since they
      use communication signals to relay identity information and must therefore be able to differentiate between
      distinct acoustic signals. The assessment of auditory discrimination in ZFs has historically been approached by
      employing operant conditioining principles, such as response-consequence associations; this presents a problem,
      since ZFs must concurrently learn to differentiate sounds and task-demands related to the learning paradigm. The
      current study employed an ethological-analysis approach to determine if birds exhibited behavioral changes in
      response to changes to a predetermined auditory stream -- a modified version of an oddball paradigm, wherein a
      stream of repeating sounds (standards; the same ZF song) is presented and, occasionally, novel sounds (oddballs;
      Canary songs) are introduced. Behavioral changes (head movements) in response to auditory playback were tracked
      via cameras and a novel, 3D pose-estimation machine-learning algorithm (DeepLabCut, Matthis Lab) was used to
      automatically track ZF features (e.g. cheeks, eyes, beak, center-of-head); the resulting datasets were used to
      detect whether deviations in head movements correlated with the presentation of auditory stimuli. On average,
      oddball presentations elicited changes in head movements that were detected in a subset of predetermined
      measurements. The results suggest that tracking behavioral changes may provide a powerful tool for determining
      whether ZFs can discriminate between different sounds, specifically in an oddball-like playback paradigm.
      Additionally, a machine learning approach to tracking physical features of ZFs proved to be a sufficiently robust
      method that decreases the need of human-power that is typically associated in the analysis of camera-recorded
      behaviors.

  <h2>Health Disparities in Medicine</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Research is being conducted on women's health, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and the racial health
    disparities affecting these topics in New Jersey. The focus is on understanding the root causes of these problems
    and finding solutions that address the needs of the community. The research takes a grassroots approach, working
    closely with community organizations, healthcare providers, and policy makers to implement solutions that can
    improve the health and well-being of women and families in the state. The aim is to reduce infant mortality and
    maternal mortality rates, and address racial health disparities to create a healthier and more equitable future for
    all women and families in New Jersey.</p>

      Abstract: The National Science Foundation (NSF) created the NSF I-Corps entrepreneurship training approach for
      academic researchers to bring their scientific innovations into the economic world by fixating on the demands of
      the potential consumer base, tackling difficulties in constructing a successful company, and a multi-disciplinary
      exploration of commercialization processes. With the maternal mortality rate for black mothers being 7 times
      higher than white mothers and the infant mortality rate for black infants being 3 times higher than white infants
      in New Jersey, the training approach - the “lean startup” methodology - was used to investigate the socioeconomic
      barriers that cause these disparities and contextualize technology’s roles in alleviating it. An AI predictive
      intervention application to prevent potential health consequences that a mother might encounter
      before/during/after the pregnancy process was used as the starting minimum viable product of the study and
      personal semi-structured interviews were conducted with minority mothers and healthcare providers. Key interview
      discussion points included but were not limited to trust in the healthcare system, technologies they used for
      their health, sources of pregnancy information, and issues with current pregnancy health apps. 27 interviews were
      conducted and 350 insights were collected to form a Business Model Canvas. Results consisted of heavy reliance but
      skepticism of Google by mothers, not enough education to make an informed decision, language barriers between the
      doctor and patient when communicating symptoms, inability to find and access a doctor, and how current apps do not
      focus on postpartum, individualized treatment, nor the mother’s social health. The findings indicate that symptom
      recorders, free maternal education, increased accessibility to doctors that speak the same language or of the same
      culture, and predictive health intervention are promising measures to address maternal health disparities.

    Sleep Deprivation in Correctional Facilities: The State of Current Knowledge and Recommendations [PRE PRINT]</a>

  <ul>
    <li>Abstract: Studies that study the impact of psychological, physical (environmental), social, and cultural
      determinants on the sleep of inmates in correctional facilities are limited. Only some within these investigate
      prevention or treatment measures for sleep deprivation or insomnia and its respective efficacy. A literature
      review was conducted via PubMed, AccessMedicine, BioMed Central, and other resources using keywords such as "sleep
      and correctional facilities", "insomnia and correctional facilities", "sleep deprivation treatment", and other
      keywords relating to correctional facilities, sleep, and the treatment of different sleep disorders. Results
      consisted of a positive feedback loop between difficulties in sleep and mental disorder factors, prior litigation
      regarding sleep being an effective means in diagnosing infrastructure concerns and concentration of efforts of
      policymakers, cognitive behavioral therapy improving 70-80% of insomnia patients, and stimulus control and
      relaxation techniques reducing nightly awakenings in inmates. Results indicated that the Psychological Services
      Inmate Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Multivariable Apnea Prediction Score are effective
      methods for calculating sleep quality in inmates, ensuring proper bedding, limiting internal conflicts between
      inmates, reducing blue light in prisons, and reassessing wake-up times is important to prevent Eighth Amendment
      violations, and that cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment measure for reducing the symptoms of
      insomnia. More research needs to be conducted on the efficacy of hypnotic medication but the implementation of it
      with non-pharmacological treatments shows promising improvements in the sleep quality of inmates.</li>
