  <h2>Cricket</h2>

  <a
        href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/cricket-club/">Rutgers Cricket Club Website</a>
  
  <p>My love for cricket started in the 2nd grade, when my dad took me to his weekend cricket matches. I got some little
    batting practice but I was there for the excitement of seeing a six or seeing the wickets getting hit by the bowler.
    Since then, I've spent my free time watching international cricket matches and series, participating in heavy tennis
    ball cricket matches, and meeting cricket players when I get the chance. I'm now getting into leather ball cricket,
    doing indoor leather ball cricket sessions once a week on average. </p>

  <p>Currently, I'm the Founder and President of Rutgers Cricket. Rutgers old cricket club disbanded prior to 2019, and
    so I decided to take on the initiative to bring cricket back to campus. It took time, but we got the club back, and
    I couldn't be more prouder. Rutgers has a rich history with cricket - winning the national tournament in 2018. It's
    great that now Rutgers students have an outlet to experience cricket on campus. </p>


  <h2>Hackathons</h2>
  <p>Hackathons are a pretty cool place to network with other individuals and create different projects in time crunch.
    I've learned many technologies via Hackathons and these events are fun to chill at. Listed below are my relevant
    hackathon experiences: </p>

  <h2>Politics</h2>
  <p>The discussion of politics is generally viewed as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, politics can be used as
    a mechanism and frameowkr for making decisions about policies to enhance the well-being of our communities; however,
    on the other hand, politics can be partisan and filled with corruption. I may not be going to law school, but I
    believe that it is a civic duty to be politically aware of what our representatives and members of government are
    doing because an educated and active voter base is crucial for a healthy and functioning democracy. I've served on
    Congressman Frank Pallone Jr.â€™s Youth Advisory Council, advising his office on local, state, and national
    issues that affect young adults and provided input on proposed legislation, and I'm a Undergraduate Associate at the
    Eagleton Institute of Politics where I combine the study of politics to applications in the real world. </p>
