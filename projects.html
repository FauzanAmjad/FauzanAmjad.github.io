  <h2>BabySafe Health</h2>

  <p><a href="https://www.babysafehealth.com/">BabySafe Health Website</a></p>

  <p>The BabySafe Health app is built to be an all-in-one guide for expecting mothers to help them through the difficult
    pregnancy process. The initial app will contain a healthcare nearby feature that will make use of the userâ€™s zip
    code to find nearby healthcare providers that BabySafe Health recommends, a symptom tracker for mothers to input
    their daily symptoms which can then be converted into a PDF to be shown to their doctors, a find friends feature for
    mothers to interact with each other creating a community, and notifications that can provide mothers with education
    relevant to the stage of their pregnancy process in multiple languages. Overall, our application aims to have a
    positive impact by providing mothers with more information at their fingertips and the appropriate resources to
    obtain the care they need to have successful outcomes. </p>

  <p>Built using React Native, the app includes the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Symptom Tracker - A tool used to record common symptoms of pregnancy (blood pressure, blood sugar, weight) as
      well as unique, personalized symptoms that occur.
    </li>
    <li>Healthcare Nearby - A comprehensive database of all maternal healthcare providers near your location, with
      reviews, pulled from Google as well as other BabySafe Health users, so you know exactly which healthcare provider
      is best suited to take care of your needs. </li>
    <li>Home Feed - Join the supportive community of BabySafe Health users in sharing your milestones during pregnancy,
      asking questions, and socializing with other expecting mothers!</li>
    <li>Future: Week by Week Education Articles, Symptom Analysis, Multiple Language Versions </li>
  </ul>

  <p>History, Awards, and Participated Programs</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rutgers NSF I-Corps: We participated in Rutgers NSF I-Corps, a program dedicated to providing student
      entrepreneurs with the resources to pursue their innovation. We interviewed mothers, doctors, and nurses through
      the
      Customer Discovery process to ensure our innovation brings beneficial change.</li>
    <li>TechUnited BetterWellness Challenge $25,000 Winner: We had the pleasure of pitching at the TechUnited Better
      Wellness Challenge @ Propelify 2021 in front of top executives within RWJBarnabas Health, Colgate-Palmolive, &
      Labcorp and won $25,000.</li>
    <li>Clinton Global Initiative University '22: Invited to Join Clinton Global Initiative 2022 Accelerator Program
    </li>
    <li>Semi-finalist in the 2021 Amazon Web Services U.S. University Startup Competition</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Acetlinx</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.acetlinx.com/">Acetlinx Website</a></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.apcsa.acetlinx.com/">AP* Computer Science A Course Website</a></p>
  <p>Acetlinx is a project I started in high school to democratize access to AP Computer Science A material to all
    students of different backgrounds and circumstances, boosting female and minority representation in the field.
    Basically, I record and publish AP Computer Science A lectures for free on YouTube that high school students can
    watch and self-study. By passing the AP Computer Science A exam, they can potentially earn college-credit, saving
    them both time and money when they get into high school. Even college students can benefits with Acetlinx's material
    as lectures are reflective of material taught in a standard Introduction to Computer Science in Java course.</p>
